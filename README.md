**ImagePickerView** is a lightweight library which brings `PHPickerViewController` / `UIImagePickerController` to `SwiftUI`.

## üíª Installation
### üì¶ Swift Package Manager
Using <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/" rel="nofollow">Swift Package Manager</a>, add it as a Swift Package in Xcode 11.0 or later, `select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` and add the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/rebeloper/ImagePickerView.git
```
### ‚úä Manual Installation
Download and include the `ImagePickerView` folder and files in your codebase.

### üì≤ Requirements
- iOS 14+ / macOS 13+
- Swift 5.3+

## üëâ Import

Import `ImagePickerView` into your `View`

```
import ImagePickerView
```

## üß≥ Features

Here's the list of the awesome features `ImagePickerView` has:
- [X] use `PHPickerViewController` as a `View` in `SwiftUI` projects (recommended, introduced in `iOS14`/`macOS13`)
- [X] use `UIImagePickerController` as a `View` in `SwiftUI` projects (iOS-only, not-recommended; use only for single image picking and when you want to enable editing) 
- [X] set `filter` and `selectionLimit` in `ImagePickerView`
- [X] `didCancel`, `didSelect` and `didFail` delegate callbacks for `ImagePickerView`
- [X] set `allowsEditing` in `UIImagePickerView`
- [X] `didCancel` and `didSelect` delegate callbacks for `UIImagePickerView`

## üíª How to Use

Selecting images from our iPhone library is needed when changing a profile picture, posting an update, or sharing the photo of your pet. In `UIKit` `Pre-iOS14` we would use `UIImagePickerController`, but as of `iOS14` Apple introduced `PHPickerViewController`. 
`ImagePickerView` supports both of them:
`UIImagePickerController` -> `UIImagePickerView`
`PHPickerViewController` -> `ImagePickerView`

Just check out these examples where the `UIImagePickerView`/`ImagePickerView` is presented upon a tap of a `Button`. 

## `UIImagePickerView`

```
import SwiftUI
import ImagePickerView

struct UIImagePickerControllerContentView: View {
    
    @State var isImagePickerViewPresented = false
    @State var pickedImage: UIImage? = nil
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 12) {
            Text("UIImagePickerView").font(.largeTitle)
            
            Button {
                isImagePickerViewPresented = true
            } label: {
                VStack {
                    if pickedImage == nil {
                        Image(systemName: "camera")
                            .font(.largeTitle)
                    } else {
                        Image(uiImage: pickedImage!)
                            .resizable()
                            .frame(width: 66, height: 66)
                            .cornerRadius(33)
                    }
                }
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $isImagePickerViewPresented) {
                UIImagePickerView(allowsEditing: true, delegate: UIImagePickerView.Delegate(isPresented: $isImagePickerViewPresented, didCancel: { (uiImagePickerController) in
                    print("Did Cancel: \(uiImagePickerController)")
                }, didSelect: { (result) in
                    let uiImagePickerController = result.picker
                    let image = result.image
                    print("Did Select image: \(image) from \(uiImagePickerController)")
                    pickedImage = image
                }))
            }
            
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

## `ImagePickerView`

```
import SwiftUI
import ImagePickerView

struct PHPickerViewControllerContentView: View {
    
    @State var isImagePickerViewPresented = false
    @State var pickedImages: [UIImage]? = nil
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 12) {
            Text("ImagePickerView").font(.largeTitle)
            
            Button {
                isImagePickerViewPresented = true
            } label: {
                VStack {
                    Image(systemName: "camera")
                        .font(.largeTitle)
                }
            }
            .sheet(isPresented: $isImagePickerViewPresented) {
                // filter default is .images; please DO NOT CHOOSE .videos
                // selectionLimit default is 1; set to 0 to have unlimited selection
                ImagePickerView(filter: .any(of: [.images, .livePhotos]), selectionLimit: 0, delegate: ImagePickerView.Delegate(isPresented: $isImagePickerViewPresented, didCancel: { (phPickerViewController) in
                    print("Did Cancel: \(phPickerViewController)")
                }, didSelect: { (result) in
                    let phPickerViewController = result.picker
                    let images = result.images
                    print("Did Select images: \(images) from \(phPickerViewController)")
                    pickedImages = images
                }, didFail: { (imagePickerError) in
                    let phPickerViewController = imagePickerError.picker
                    let error = imagePickerError.error
                    print("Did Fail with error: \(error) in \(phPickerViewController)")
                }))
            }
            
            if pickedImages != nil {
                ScrollView {
                    ForEach(pickedImages!, id:\.self) { image in
                        Image(uiImage: image)
                            .resizable()
                            .frame(width: 66, height: 66)
                            .cornerRadius(33)
                    }
                }
            }
            
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
